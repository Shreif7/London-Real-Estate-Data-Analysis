# 🏠 London Real Estate Market Analysis | Advanced Pricing & Segmentation Study

Advanced end-to-end statistical analysis of London residential property data using Python.  
This project goes beyond basic EDA to uncover structural market segmentation, premium price drivers, and the statistical distortion effect of luxury outliers.

---

## 🎯 Analytical Objective

This study was designed to answer high-impact analytical questions:

- Is London’s property market randomly distributed or structurally tiered?
- What statistically explains premium pricing?
- How do outliers influence central tendency metrics?
- Which variables truly drive valuation: location, size, type, or age?

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data transformation & statistical computation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Distribution & correlation visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Analytical workflow documentation  
- **Web Scraping** – Data enrichment for incomplete attributes  

---

## 🧹 Data Engineering Workflow

- Data integrity validation & missing value treatment
- Standardization of borough & property classifications
- Feature engineering:
  - Price per square meter
  - Market tier segmentation
- Distribution analysis & boxplot-based outlier detection
- Borough-level and property-type aggregations
- Correlation matrix evaluation

Cleaned dataset structured for statistical reliability before insight extraction.

## 📊 Structural Market Segmentation

Clear **market bifurcation** identified:

- £1M–£4M → Core Transaction Tier  
- £4M–£5M → Premium / Luxury Tier  

This confirms that London’s housing market follows a tiered pricing structure rather than a normal distribution.

---

## 📈 Outlier Impact Analysis

- Premium properties significantly inflate the **mean**.
- Median proved to be a more stable pricing benchmark.
- High-value outliers were almost exclusively **Detached Houses**.

Conclusion: Luxury segment exerts disproportionate influence on market-level statistics.

## 🏘 Primary Price Drivers Identified

### 1️⃣ Location Dominance
Kensington, Westminster, and Chelsea consistently record the highest average prices — confirming geographic prestige as a primary valuation driver.

### 2️⃣ Property Type Effect
Detached Houses dominate the premium tier and represent the majority of statistical outliers.

### 3️⃣ Floor Area Correlation
Strong positive correlation between property size and price escalation — especially within the £3M–£5M segment.

### 4️⃣ Amenities & Specifications
Upgraded features significantly amplify price premiums within prime boroughs.

### 5️⃣ Property Age (Minimal Impact)
Age showed limited statistical influence when compared to size and location strength.

## 📉 Statistical Observations

- Distribution is right-skewed due to luxury outliers.
- Mean price is upward-biased.
- Market core volume remains concentrated in mid-tier pricing.
- Premium segment creates artificial perception of overall market inflation.

---

## 🔎 Analytical Insights

- London real estate is structurally segmented, not randomly priced.
- Size + location synergy creates exponential price growth.
- Premium boroughs create localized inflation pockets.
- Outlier-aware modeling is essential for accurate valuation.
